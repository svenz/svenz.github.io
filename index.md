# Rick Sanchez

Rick Sanchez is one of the two eponymous protagonists from the Adult Swim animated television series Rick and Morty. Created by Justin Roiland and Dan Harmon, Sanchez is a misanthropic alcoholic scientist inspired by Emmett "Doc" Brown from Back to the Future. Known for his reckless, nihilistic behavior and pessimistic personality, the character has been well received. He is a sociopathic mad scientist who seems to know everything in the universe and thus finds life a traumatizing and pointless experience. However, despite assuming himself to be the smartest person in the universe, there have been times where he has been wrong. 

He is formally referred to as Rick Sanchez C-137 by the Trans-Dimensional Council of Ricks, in reference to his original universe, "C-137". Both Rick and Morty are voiced by Roiland. Volume 1 of the Rick and Morty comic series follows the Rick and Morty of Dimension C-132 while most episodes of subsequent installments follow the Rick and Morty of "C-137"; the video game Pocket Mortys follows the Rick and Morty of C-123.
